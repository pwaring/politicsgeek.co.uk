Here's something you don't hear every day, a [Liberal Democrat defecting to the Conservative party](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7168073.stm). Not only is this an unusual switch -- what with the Lib Dems consisting largely of rejects from other parties -- but it gives the Tories their first council seat in Manchester for over a decade. Admittedly it's only one councillor rather than a wave of defections, but given the strategic nature of Manchester and the need for the Tories to make inroads in the inner cities if they want to regain their lost status as a meaningful political force, I can imagine Conservative Central Office making a big song and dance about this news story.
