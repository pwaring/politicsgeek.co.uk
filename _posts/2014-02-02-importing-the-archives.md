Before moving over to Politics Geek, I used to write a political blog on another site called Politics Watch.[^politics-watch] Although some of the articles now look out of date - my political opinions have changed in the intervening 6+ years - I've imported most of them for posterity.[^missing-articles] As a rough guide, anything up until 2010 was on Politics Watch, and anything from 2012 onwards (when I started writing again) was first posted on Politics Geek.

Enjoy!

[^politics-watch]: Nothing to do with politicswatch.com, though the owners of that site did pay a solicitor to try and get me to give up the domain. I responded refuting all their arguments and never heard from them again.

[^missing-articles]: A few articles as missing as they relied on links to other sites which no longer exist.
