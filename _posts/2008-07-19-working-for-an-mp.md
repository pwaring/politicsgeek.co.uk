I came across this amazing site, [w4mp](http://www.w4mp.org/), which provides you with a huge range of resources related to working for MPs, whether in a constituency office or in Westminster. Some of the information is only relevant or available to current members of staff, but there is plenty of advice and information available for anyone looking for a career which involves working for an MP.

Working for an MP is a useful way to make the connections required to get into politics, so if you're thinking of a career along those lines -- as I have in the past -- then w4mp is well worth a look.
