A few days ago, I mentioned [plans to stop the government's proposal to cut funding for second degrees](/2008/01/08/protests-at-cuts-for-adult-learning/) and how ridiculous I thought this Labour initiative was. Unfortunately, the Conservative motion opposing the cuts was [defeated by a margin of 53 votes](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7178836.stm), and as a result it looks as if the plans will go ahead, with the cuts starting to hit budgets in 2008-2009. A sad day for education, and yet another example of why we should give this Labour government the boot at the earliest possible opportunity.
