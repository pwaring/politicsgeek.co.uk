For those of you who are interested in a wrap-up of this year's political events, the BBC has a 20 minute [review of the political year](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7795361.stm) available for streaming via their website. I'm not sure if this is available to people outside the UK, but it's worth a watch if you want a gentle overview of how things have gone for our politicians in 2009. I'll be posting my own review of the political year in the next few days, though alas it won't be televised.
