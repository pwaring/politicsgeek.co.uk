In a dramatic statement issued a few minutes ago, Charles Kennedy admitted he has been taking treatment for alcohol-related problems in the past eighteen months and called a leadership election. He still intends to stand as a candidate for the top job, but personally I think his luck has run out and the Lib Dems will have a new leader before the local elections in May - assuming of course that they don't make a pig's ear of the whole business like the Conservatives did.
