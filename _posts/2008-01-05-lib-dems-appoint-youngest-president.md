[Lib Dems get 'youngest' president](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/derbyshire/4581716.stm)

Oliver Smith, a member of Amber Valley Lib Dems in Derbyshire, has become the president of his local party association at the young age of twelve years. I'm somewhat surprised at this, as I thought there would be a minimum age to join a political party (not legally binding, but enforced by the parties themselves voluntarily), and it seems a bit strange to have someone who probably has a very limited knowledge of politics presiding over a local association. However, the president doesn't really have many duties, most of the important roles are taken on by the association's chairman (assuming a degree of similarity with the way local Conservative associations work), so it could just be an amusing publicity stunt more than anything else.
