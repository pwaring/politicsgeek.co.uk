Several people have asked me for a diagram which outlines the ownership structure of the Royal Mail after privatisation. The number of entities and relationships makes it a bit messy, but it's probably still less complicated than the corporate structure of other large public companies such as Lloyds Banking Group.

**Line colours:**

 * Black: Full ownership
 * Blue: Partial ownership
 * Green: Commercial relationship
 * Red: Government relationship

**Shapes:**

 * Hexagon: Government entity
 * Box: Company
 * Ellipse: Brand

Apologies for the lack of legend on the graph, it's created using [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) and generating a key/legend appears to be a long-winded process. You can find the [source file](https://github.com/pwaring/notes/blob/master/politics-geek/royal-mail-ownership.gv) used to generate the graph on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/pwaring) - patches welcome if you want to suggest improvements.
