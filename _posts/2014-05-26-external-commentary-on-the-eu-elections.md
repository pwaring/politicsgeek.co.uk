After posting [my thoughts on the European election results](/2014/05/26/european-election-results-2014/), I felt it would be a good idea to collate some of the articles I came across whilst scanning the headlines. These articles are listed in no particular order, I've tried to include as a wide a range of sources as possible, and a link doesn't imply endorsement or agreement.

 * [Mainstream parties have been defeated by the monster they created](http://symonhill.wordpress.com/2014/05/26/mainstream-parties-have-been-defeated-by-the-monster-they-created/) (Symon Hill)
 * [Ouch. My first thoughts on the European election results for the four main parties](http://www.libdemvoice.org/opinion-an-open-letter-to-nick-clegg-40340.html) (Lib Dem Voice)
 * [Farage's gamble pays off - but where do Ukip go next?](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/05/farages-gamble-pays-where-do-ukip-go-next) (New Statesman)

If you know of a particularly interesting article which I've missed, please let me know and I'll update the post.
