One of my friends just forwarded me a to this [hilarious pledge](http://www.pledgebank.com/yayboris) on [PledgeBank](http://www.pledgebank.com). Only 818 people have signed up at the time of writing this post, but I've lost count of the number of people who have told me that they'd vote Conservative if Boris was the leader of the party.

It's unlikely that this pledge will change anything, however we can but hope...
