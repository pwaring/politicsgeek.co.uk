This morning the Supreme Court handed down its judgement in the 'Brexit case',
which included two other related cases from Northern Ireland.[^judgement]

Broadly speaking, two questions were put before the court:

 1. Does the Government have the power to invoke Article 50 without the consent
 of Parliament, using a technique called the Royal Prerogative?
 2. Do the devolved Parliaments/Assemblies of Scotland, Wales and Northern
 Ireland need to be consulted before Article 50 is invoked, and if so does that
 consultation also require consent?

The courts had four options open to them:

 1. Allow the use of the Royal Prerogative to invoke Article 50, bypassing
 Parliament altogether. This would have been a total victory for the Government,
 who had argued that this was a legally correct course of action.
 2. Require the consent of the UK Parliament to invoke Article 50. This was what
 the original claimants argued for, and would be an inconvenience for the
 Government.
 3. Require either the consultation or consent of the devolved Parliaments
 and Assemblies to invoke Article 50. This would have been a disaster for the
 Government, given that they only command a majority in the UK as a whole and
 not in the devolved regions.
 4. Refer the matter to the European Court of Justice. This would also have been
 a disaster for the Government, and would have opened up another can of worms
 about whether the ECJ could prevent or place conditions on a country wishing to
 leave the EU.

The substantive issue at the core of the case was the use of the Royal
Prerogative, which is a device that enables the Crown to take action without
approval from Parliament. In practice this means Her Majesty's Government, in
the form of ministers such as the Secretary of State for Exiting the European
Union.

The extent of the Royal Prerogative has been curtailed over the years, usually
by passing Acts of Parliament.[^statute-trumps-rp] However, one power which
still exists is that the Crown can enter into and exit from treaties without the
consent of Parliament. Normally this is not an issue, but in this case there is
a piece of legislation, the European Communities Act 1972, which legislated for
the UK joining the predecessor body to the EU.

Now we have a problem. The Royal Prerogative cannot be used to change law made by
Acts of Parliament, and leaving the EU would likely require the amendment or
repeal of lots of legislation, not least the 1972 Act. It could be argued that,
as the 1972 Act would still be in force and would still govern our membership
relationship with the EU, invoking Article 50 would not actually change the law.
Even once the UK had left the EU, the 1972 Act would continue to govern our
membership, it would just have no effect because we would no longer be a member.
I think this is tenuous and pedantic, but we appoint highly experienced judges
to make these decisions for a reason.

In the end, the Court ruled by a majority of 8-3 that the Royal Prerogative
could not be used to invoke Article 50, so the UK Parliament will have to pass
legislation to start the process. This is frustrating for the Government, as it
will delay matters and they may not meet their arbitrary deadline of the end of
March, but it will not stop them. The Government has a small majority in the
House of Commons and defeating them would require rebellions or abstentions on
the Conservative side, even if the other side of the House unanimously opposed
the 'Article 50 Bill'. Given that Labour has already indicated that it will not
oppose Article 50 notification in principle -- though it may put forward
amendments -- this means Article 50 notification will happen in the next couple
of months.

As for the devolution option, unfortunately the Court ruled unanimously that
there is no requirement to obtain consent, or even to consult. The reason why
can be seen from section 28 of the Scotland Act 1998, which covers Acts of the
Scottish Parliament (Wales and Northern Ireland have similar legislation):

> s28(7): This section does not affect the power of the Parliament of the United
> Kingdom to make laws for Scotland.

> s28(8): But it is recognised that the Parliament of the United Kingdom will not
> normally legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent of the
> Scottish Parliament.

It is clear from the above that, whilst the Scottish Parliament can expect to be
consulted on legislation, this consultation is not guaranteed and in any case
the consent of the Scottish Parliament is not required. As the judges point out,
a convention like the one above is political, not legal. Courts cannot rule on
anything other than legal matters, and attempts to enforce political conventions
in the courts can and do fail. There may of course be political consequences for
ignoring a convention, such as a reduction in votes at the next election, but
this is not an area where the courts can or should interfere.

For people who were pro-Remain, the demolition of the devolution argument is
unfortunate, as it had the potential to derail the whole process if, for
example, the Scottish Parliament was able to veto a notification under Article 50.
However, it was always a fragile argument and I can't see any other way in
which the judges could have interpreted the legislation.

One final note: the question of whether a notification under Article 50 can be
withdrawn or given in qualified or conditional terms (e.g. subject to a second
referendum) was not fully addressed. Partly this was because, as the judgement
put it, it is 'common ground' that the notification cannot be withdrawn, and
also because it would make no difference to the outcome of this case. One could
therefore argue that, whilst the Article 50 notification is unlikely to be
stopped, it might be possible to withdraw it at a later date. Even if this is
not possible under the law as it stands, there is always the option, if you
could get sufficient agreement in the EU, to add an exception to Article 50
allowing the UK to withdraw its notification. After all, it's not as if we don't
already have opt-outs from lots of other things...

[^judgement]: [Article 50 Brexit Appeal](https://www.supremecourt.uk/news/article-50-brexit-appeal.html)

[^statute-trumps-rp]: If a statute and the Royal Prerogative disagree, the statute 'wins'. Since Acts of Parliament require Royal Assent, the Crown has effectively agreed to the curtailment, even if Royal Assent is now a formality.

[^mp-resignation]: Technically an MP cannot resign as such, so instead they are appointed to an office which is incompatible with being a member of the House of Commons. This effectively disqualifies them and their seat becomes vacant. However, the office is only held temporarily, so there is no restriction on the former MP from standing in the resulting by-election.
