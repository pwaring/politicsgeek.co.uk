One of my goals for this year is to create and stick to a writing schedule for all of my non-personal blogs - currently <a href="http://www.phpdeveloper.org.uk">PHP Developer</a>, <a href="http://www.politicsgeek.co.uk">Politics Geek</a> and <a href="http://www.insurancepaul.co.uk">Insurance Paul</a>.

So as of March, I'll be aiming to write for Politics Geek twice a week, with posts scheduled for 6pm on Wednesdays and Saturdays. I won't necessarily write the posts on those days - it's more likely I'll queue them both the weekend before -  but that's when they will appear on the site and RSS feed.

Two posts a week seems a sensible balance between how frequently I'd like to write (all the time) and how much free time I have (not enough).
