I recently came across [Liberal Democrat Voice](http://www.libdemvoice.org/), courtesy of a local Lib Dem activist who I occasionally enjoy a round of [beer and curry](http://www.currybeer.com/) with. It claims to be 'the best read independent website for Lib Dems' and is basically a blog consisting of a number of contributors, all of whom are Lib Dem members. Of course, it's full of lefty liberal hand-wringing, "isn't our leader, who no one outside the party has heard of, great" nonsense, but occasionally there is something worth reading, such as the following posts:

 * [Five tech tips for the New Year](http://www.libdemvoice.org/tag/five-tech-tips)
 * [Fighting media bias â€“ you can help us](http://www.libdemvoice.org/fighting-media-bias-you-can-help-us-17281.html)
 * [Televised party leader debates: get your worms at the ready](http://www.libdemvoice.org/televised-party-leader-debates-get-your-worms-at-the-ready-17297.html)

There's also an interesting [best of the blogs](http://www.libdemvoice.org/category/best-of-the-blogs) feature if you want to extend your reading beyond the team of site contributors. Oh and it's powered by WordPress, so it must be good.

Even if you're not a Lib Dem, it's always good to keep an eye on what the other side is up to...
