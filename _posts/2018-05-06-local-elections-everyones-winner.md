All councils from the recent local elections have now declared their final results
and it seems that every party -- with the exception perhaps of UKIP -- can
declare victory in some form or another.

## Conservatives

A net loss of 33 councillors from 1,332 (2.5%) is hardly a disaster in mid-term
local elections, which are often seen as a chance to express dissatisfaction with
the current government. Given the continued bungling around Brexit, plus recent
scandals such as Windrush, the results could have been far worse. Losing Trafford
council was probably the only disaster of the night, as it leaves them with no
councils in Greater Manchester, but it has only swung to No Overall Control rather
than to Labour. Careful expectations management also meant that these results
could be presented as being 'as expected'.

## Labour

Gaining councillors is always a positive step for the opposition party, and
Labour made the greatest net gains in absolute terms. They failed to make any
net gains in terms of councils controlled, although forcing Trafford into No
Overall Control can be seen as a symbolic victory as it leaves no opposition to
Labour in Greater Manchester, where they are now the largest party on every
council. A better result might be expected at this point in the electoral cycle,
and may have helped Corbyn convince some of his critics that he is the right man
for the job, but they were in no way a disaster.

## Liberal Democrats

The biggest winners by far were the Lib Dems, with a 14% increase in the number
of councillors and, perhaps more importantly, a net gain of 4 councils. It feels
like the party is finally recovering after the appalling showing in the 2015
general election (and, to a lesser extent, 2017). The question now that the party
has avoided oblivion -- something I thought was fairly unlikely -- is whether
it can build on these gains in future elections and retake its place as a
challenger to the two main parties.

## Greens

Similar to the Lib Dems, the Greens had a significant percentage increase in
councillors elected, albeit from a low base. I'm not sure if this was helped by
the Lib Dems not standing candidates against the Greens in some areas, including
my ward, and whether there was any form of electoral pact in place between the
two parties. A good result all round though, especially considering that the
Greens are often ignored in press coverage.

## UKIP

Admittedly UKIP are the outlier to the title of this blog post. The only way I
can think of to put a positive spin on losing almost all of their councillors up
for re-election is that the party has achieved its goal of winning a vote to
leave the European Union. Given that the Conservatives and Labour are both
pro-Brexit -- and a hard Brexit at that -- UKIP can argue that its job is done,
and from a pragmatic perspective there's no point in continuing to exist as a
separate party.

Overall, the results seem to have been a consolidation of Labour in the North
and Conservatives in the South, with UKIP being wiped out and replaced by the
Lib Dems and Greens.
