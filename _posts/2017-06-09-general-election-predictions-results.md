Well, that was unexpected, though Psychic Paul was slightly more foresightful
than in 2015.

To recap my predictions were:

**Conservatives:**

 * Double-figure majority: Wrong.
 * Gains in Scotland: Right (net gain of 12).
 * Theresa May remains PM: Right (as of time of writing).

**Labour:**

 * Squeezed in Scotland: Wrong (net gain of 6 seats).
 * Corbyn will fare better than Miliband: Right.
 * Corbyn forced out in 2017/18: Unknown, but probably wrong.

**Liberal Democrats:**

 * Gains limited to a handful of seats: Right (net gain of 4).

**SNP:**

 * Loss of seats: Right (net loss of 21).

**UKIP:**

 * Vote collapse: Right (down 10.8 percentage points)

**Greens:**

 * Solitary MP: Right.

It's a good job I didn't place a bet on a Conservative majority though.
