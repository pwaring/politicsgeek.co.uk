[Kennedy making personal statement](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4582930.stm)

Charles Kennedy has announced that he will be making a personal statement at the Liberal Democrat headquarters at 1745 GMT today, apparently to pre-empt media allegations about alcohol problems. The statement is not expected to be a resignation announcement, although given the lack of confidence expressed in his leadership by senior members of the party it wouldn't surprise me if Kennedy did step down this evening. According to the BBC there is also a letter signed by eleven of the party's spokespeople informing Kennedy that they are no longer confident in his leadership.

Given the potential importance of this announcement and the fact that there has been little political news of interest over the Christmas Parlimentary recess, I imagine it will broadcast on least one of the major terrestial television channels.
