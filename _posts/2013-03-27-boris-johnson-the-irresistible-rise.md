I'm still writing up my thoughts on the 2013 Budget, but in the meantime I noticed this documentary on the BBC iPlayer which I felt was worth sharing:Â [Boris Johnson: The Irresistible Rise](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01rlx9l/Boris_Johnson_The_Irresistible_Rise/). It's worth watching even if you hate Boris and wish Ken was still running London.
