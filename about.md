Politics Geek contains my thoughts on UK political news. Generally I favour depth over breadth, so you're likely to see a small number of long articles, each one looking at a specific issue in detail. Wherever possible, I back up quotes, arguments etc. with sources, so readers can make up their own mind.

**About Paul**

In the dim and distant past (c. 2001-2004), I was a member of the Conservative party. I'm no longer a member of, or affiliated to, any particular party.

Any opinions are mine alone and not those of my employer, freelance clients or organisations which I might be involved with.
